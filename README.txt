<h3>Features</h3>

<h4>Automated clean-up</h4>

Each cloned installation consumes the server resources (CPU, memory, disk space etc ...). Demo Generator for WP allows you to set an automatic cleanup delay for every cloned installation to free up server resources at the end of each session.

<h4>User specific roles</h4>

WordPress allows you to create users with limited access rights. These users will retain their limited access to the clones and their identities (usernames, emails and passwords) will be automatically modified and communicated to the users during the generation of each demo.

<h4>Privacy</h4>

Demo Generator for WP allows each visitor to access a private demo installation on demand.This will allow them to easily have a feel of your product prior to purchase.
Each user has their own site and wonâ€™t share their demo site with any other tester. 

<h4>Automatic demo update</h4>

Changes made to the default demo will be instantly updated on every new demo generated by the user.
